# Fast-Food-Nutrition
This is a personal Project in which I wanted to rank Meals and Drinks from different Fast-Food Chains based on nutritional data. The dataset can be found here:

## General Information
As someone who always had an interest in health and nutrition, I was excited to stumble upon this Kaggle Dataset about Nutritional Data on Fast-Food Restaurants. 

The goal was categorize these Chains into healthiest and worst options. Healthy Products are determined by facors such as Protein, Sugar and Fat content aswell as Caloric Density (how many calories per gram). 

To conclude, I wanted to have a visual Dashboard that provides Info on the Products these Restaurants offer and also displays a score for every meal so someone could make an easy and informed choice on where to get a quick bite.
